    <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p> This year, I was asked to create a website for the Wellington Speaking Union (WSU),
        an organisation that runs public speaking and debating tournaments for students. <br>
        Their old website was outdated, and Brooke, the current President of WSU wanted a redone site
        for their use. <br>
        Before creating the website, Brooke and I needed to collaborate and discuss what this website
        would be used for, and what we wanted to achieve out of its creation. From this point, we created
        a list of our key aims that would allow Brooke to be as involved in the process, and in providing
        feedback throughout this project.<br>
        In any website, it is important that UX studies are conducted so that the website fits the needs of
        not only the owner, but also the consumers who will be using and navigating the website.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> I contacted and interviewed four categories of users who would be accessing and interacting
       with the website. I wanted to find out their frustrations with the old site, and their expectations
        for the design and the active elements of the site.</li>
        <li> I also did competition analysis to start having an understanding of what needed to be included in
        this site and what other similar websites had used in terms of design and the features that they included.
        This also enables me to think about both what their site is lacking, and doing a good job in to help me
        when choosing what would work for this site. </li>
        <li> Finally, completing a project backlog to have a better grasp on the "big picture" idea for this site
        but evidently, this is just a simple plan with none of the specific details of features and designs included
        as these are subject to change.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2> Relevant Implications Databases</h2>

    <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">

        <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
            <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                <div class="fw-bold">Privacy</div>
                Unfortunately, attention has not been focused on the privacy aspect of this site. However, this is not
                of huge concern to us at this moment because the databases are unable to be directly accessed by any
                users of the site. Using the shortcut http:..../data in the search bar will not take users to the
                data folder. In the case where the builder (myself) or any other admins are able to access the data
                folder, all passwords are censored out. Additionally, the site is not built with the intention of
                collecting much personal or valuable data from each of the users as there is no need or use for that.
                Therefore, any data that is collected by the site should not need to be of any concern to the users. The
                maximum amount of data that is collected is password, and email - both of which are not sources of
                compromising information such as an address, age, school etc would be.
                We also have not done much about privacy of persons displayed in our photos. The current photos in the
                site as of this moment were taken and displayed with permission, and it will be up to the administrators
                to take down photos wherein the person photographed no longer consents to having their image displayed
                on the page. Photos that are attached to (eg) an upcoming news item, or past event which are connected
                to databases have the ability to be removed as part of the "edit" function on these specific databases.
            </div>
            <span class="badge bg-primary rounded-pill">14</span>
        </li>

        <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
            <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                <div class="fw-bold">Functionality</div>
                Content for list item
            </div>
            <span class="badge bg-primary rounded-pill">14</span>
        </li>

        <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
            <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                <div class="fw-bold">Sustainability and Future Proofing</div>
                The database should be easily maintained by the administrator, and any edits that need to be made are
                central to only one area. This isn't true for database tables such as news where other tables
                like member needs to be referenced with a foreign key, or with comments, where two foreign keys -
                user and news are both referred to. Therefore, if any changes are made to the member table, then all
                tables that reference this member table with a foreign key will automatically adjust with the changes
                instead of needing to manually change each member within each table.
                For the creation of the 'draw', I initially planned to have three different tables - grade, round, and
                finally the draw - however, this excessive and in order to reduce resources and to make it easier to
                maintain everything, I condensed everything into one table. In this situation, the grade, round and draw
                did not have to be separate entities, and could still effectively operate in one table.
            </div>
            <span class="badge bg-primary rounded-pill">14</span>
        </li>

        <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
            <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                <div class="fw-bold">End User Considerations</div>
                The data in the database, and ability to enter, delete and edit data should be queried and displayed in
                a way that is easy for users to understand and to use. Many of the users in the UX interviews
                preferred designs that were simple and modern, with not too much block text. Therefore, the
                styling and forms that have been created so that users can interact with the databases is designed
                in this way. Additionally, all of these forms have catches that prevent users from submitting forms with
                incorrect (e.g. not putting in a valid email address in the sign-up form) or impartial information (e.g.
                when submitting a post to the upcoming events section or recent news). Although most of the design
                elements in the site have consideration of viewers who are using different devices (e.g. a mobile phone),
                I have not necessarily considered these varying screen sizes when it comes to the design and styling of
                the forms thus far. Whilst they should still be usable, they may not be to the standard that is
                comfortable for all types of users.

            <span class="badge bg-primary rounded-pill">14</span>

            <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                <div class="fw-bold">Usability</div>
                In the end, I think that usability is not necessarily maximised for all types of users. With the
                resources available, they have primarily been optimised for a user on a laptop or computer, with
                significant efforts made to adjust design elements and features for mobile users as well. This may
                mean that some features like entering a post may be difficult for users on mobile devices
                which is a flaw of this site. However, the website is broadly easy to navigate with a sticky nav bar
                that allows users to immediately navigate to other pages if they cannot find the information that
                they need, or if they clicked something wrong.

    <h3>Initial Designs</h3>

    <p> For the WSU site, I first started to plan out what database tables I wanted to include. This also helps me to
        keep track of where foreign keys should be used instead of an entirely new identity, and also to examine how
        the tables all interconnect and interact with each other. The first table that I needed to include was the
        member table as this impacts other tables.
        <ul>
        <li>
        On the news page, there are three tables - comments, recent news and upcoming events. Therefore, this
        is the page where most of the database activity is occurring. Since WSU is an organisation that arranges
        debates and public speaking competitions, recent news and upcoming events will be key features of the site
        and therefore, should be prioritised. This allows all four groups of expected users: teachers, students,
        coaches as well as judges to be able to keep up with events that they can attend, and what happened at those
        various competitions. For the administrators, or other authorised users, this will be the hub for keeping
        those users up-to-date, and it should be easy for them to use the forms to post, edit and delete various
        news items.
        </li>
        <li>
        Another useful database that is not set in the "news" page is the draw table. This was a popular demand from
        the interviews conducted in the planning stage. Many students and coaches like to keep up to date with who
        their teams will be debating, and also to look back on what debates have already happened.
        </li>
        </ul>

    This is the updated database schema/plan for the databases on the WSU site:

    <!-- SPRINTS -->

    <h3>Sprint Six</h3>
    <h4> Aim: </h4>
    <p>To create the first iteration of the database:
        Build only two linked tables: news and member tables.
    <br> Run installation and test</p>
    <p>The data plan for these tables is below</p>

    </div>

    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    <p> It took a few goes to get the sql installer file running but,now it is place,
        I can add to it and reinstall the database whenever I want to.
    This will be very useful.<br>
    After a few false starts I got the query to run and print out, using a testing file.
        This means I can work out and test a query before implementing in the flask server file.</p>
