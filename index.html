    <h2 id="br">Brief</h2>
        <p> This year, I was asked to create a website for the Wellington Speaking Union (WSU),
        an organisation that runs public speaking and debating tournaments for students. <br>
        Their old website was outdated, and Brooke, the current President of WSU wanted a redone site
        for their use. <br>
        Before creating the website, Brooke and I needed to collaborate and discuss what this website
        would be used for, and what we wanted to achieve out of its creation. From this point, we created
        a list of our key aims that would allow Brooke to be as involved in the process, and in providing
        feedback throughout this project.<br>
        In any website, it is important that UX studies are conducted so that the website fits the needs of
        not only the owner, but also the consumers who will be using and navigating the website.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> I contacted and interviewed four categories of users who would be accessing and interacting
       with the website. I wanted to find out their frustrations with the old site, and their expectations
        for the design and the active elements of the site.</li>
        <li> I also did competition analysis to start having an understanding of what needed to be included in
        this site and what other similar websites had used in terms of design and the features that they included.
        This also enables me to think about both what their site is lacking, and doing a good job in to help me
        when choosing what would work for this site. </li>
        <li> Finally, completing a project backlog to have a better grasp on the "big picture" idea for this site
        but evidently, this is just a simple plan with none of the specific details of features and designs included
        as these are subject to change.</li>
        </ul>

                    <div class="fw-bold">Intellectual Property</div>
                    Intellectual property is the idea of who owns the images, ideas, and the text that is used on the website.
                    This involves trademark and copyright law, whether the images used have been copyrighted, what rules apply
                    to ensure that all of these products of intellect have been used legally. For example, images used should
                    only be displayed if given permission by the person who owns them. The easiest way to do this is to take
                    your own photos, but if using images off the internet, it is important to understand Creative Commons
                    licensing. The idea is that all work is copyrighted even if the symbol is not used or it’s not clearly
                    stated, but if the author has given permission for others to freely use (or use with restrictions) their
                    work, then it is okay. This is extremely important because no one likes having their work stolen from
                    them, or not having their work clearly depicted as being theirs.

                    <div class="fw-bold">Accessibility</div>
                    Accessibility means that all users who want to use the site, can. Generally, this is twofold:
                    firstly, that anyone who could access the site, is able to (through any sort of device). Secondly,
                    that all types of people are able to use it. There are a large variety of groups who may have
                    disabilities that need recognition such as those with dyslexia, colour-blindness, impaired vision.
                    However, these people also need to be able to successfully use the resources that are available on
                    the website. By considering the implications of these, having a focus on accessibility means
                    ensuring that there are ways / changes on the website which allow easy navigation and use of the
                    website. For example, this could include having responsive design that adjusts the content on the
                    page depending on the size of the browser. Or ensuring that the text is large enough for all to read,
                    and that the colour scheme is appropriate (not using bright yellow against a white background).

                    <div class="fw-bold">Aesthetics</div>
                    Aesthetics focuses on making the website visually-appealing and appreciating the graphic design
                    involved. 	This is quite important because someone’s first impression of a website may change their
                    attitudes towards it. For example, if all of the photos are grainy, and the website is not formatted
                    properly, someone may think that the information on it, or the resources are no good. Additionally,
                    you want the audience to enjoy using your website, and to make sure that it appeals to the right
                    audience. Using CRAP design principles, and having a continuous colour scheme will help improve
                    cohesiveness which will make people happy to be using the website.

                    <div class="fw-bold">Future proofing</div>
                    Future proofing the website ensures that the website is kept up to date. This means that outdated
                    content can be deleted, old but still necessary content can be updated, and new information can also
                    be added. Since most users do not know how to do these manually, it is important that there are easy
                    means for any user to be able to perform these functions. Future proofing is important because it
                    makes the website timeless, and always relevant. This means that anyone at any point in time can find
                    some use in accessing it! By using databases to manage the website, store content and make the form
                    option available means that the website will always be able to be used and won’t waste away.

    <h5>Reflection</h5>
    <p>
        The layout design was one of the most difficult elements, and it had to be done perfectly because it would be
        showcased on each of the pages. The basic idea with the layout was to get a functional navbar and footer.
        Creating the initial navbar and footer were easy because I have done it before, however, this year I needed to
        be aware of how the page would look with a mobile view, or a smaller screen. Therefore, I needed to make the
        hamburger nav which went well. What was difficult was creating a sticky nav. Since I had done some other overlay
        things, the sticky nav wasn’t working properly because some of the overlays would go over the sticky nav as well.
        However, I managed to fix this. I then had some difficulties with the other side of the nav (where the login and
        signup buttons are) because I didn’t know how to put the two buttons next to each other. At this point, they were
        just going underneath each other - however, using some mx-auto and also positioning things helped to fix this.
        With the footer, everyone was ok except for the social media icons. I couldn't centre the icons properly, and the
        gaps between the text were too large. Once I managed to centre the icons, everything looked good.

    <p>
        The homepage coding itself went well. The trickiest elements were the cards and the overlays, and the cards took
        multiple attempts before I got them to all be the same height. I tried h-100, I tried ensuring that all of the text
        was the same length, but it wasn’t working properly. However, eventually, I managed to fix it. But then, when the
        page was minimised, the cards weren’t the same height. To fix this, I just needed to do the same bug fix in the
        media-query section. This page also involved two major overlays: button, and also the photo in the “welcome”
        section. Although creating the photo overlay was fine, there were issues when the screen was minimised. I managed
        to get it to fold on top of the photo after a few attempts which looked better than it only going through half
        of the page. The button overlay was relatively easy to position, but I have had a button flashing blue after the
        button is clicked, and I have been unable to fix this thus far.

    <h5>Reflection</h5>
    <p>
        The competitions page went well in terms of finding good photos. I decided to use cards again, except this time,
        I used circular images. Although the actual design looked nice, the circular images proved a problem because the
        difference in the number of cards meant that between the “debating” and “public speaking” sections, the circular
        images weren’t the same size. Additionally, in the “public speaking” section, the cards were too far apart and
        therefore looked weird. I managed to fix this by doing mx-auto and also w-50, which made all the circular images
        look the same, and not be too far apart. I also had a couple of issues with the parallax image. This was the
        first page where I used a parallax, which is why I struggled here. Initially, I had a yellow backdrop to the text
        (this was on top of the parallax) image, but I eventually ended up switching that out for plain white text.
        Additionally, I also had a secondary nav bar to direct users around the page, but that looked clunky and out of
        place, so I ended up getting rid of it.

        The news page took a while to design, but went relatively smoothly. In this sprint, I made a non-functional

        “upcoming” and “recent” which is where the majority of the database work was outputted. More information
        about this sprint can be found on my news database reflections as those included front-end designs of the elements
        within these containers.

            were initially going to be used as links to different pages on the website which contained resources
            for the end-users. However, that idea changed to using the grids as a "secondary nav" as seen in Draft Four.</h5>

    <h5>Reflection</h5>
    <p>
        The resources page was fun, and went through several design ideas. Initially, I wanted to do a 2x2 grid,
        where users would click the corresponding cell (for teachers, for students, for coaches, for judges) to be
        directed to the resources for the group required. The reason for using this design was to reduce clutter which
        the resources page would have been prone to as it includes many hyperlinks, text, and other resourceful information.
        Although the users thought that this design was sufficient, my client mentioned that this would increase the number
        of pages a user would need to click through in order to reach their destination. Additionally, I spent a lot of time
        trying to sort out the various columns, and not only was this difficult, but the end-result was still relatively messy.
        I decided to move in a different direction, using one row with four columns. However, this design was ugly, and the
        text was hard to manage. Eventually, I settled on an accordion design. This was tricky as it was my first time coding
        an accordion, and there were a few issues with the styling of the title, keeping the accordion items open, however, I
        managed to fix these relatively quickly. This is the page which has the most external links, and
        finding good and appropriate resources took a long time, but I think that there is a good collection. Despite the
        challenges, I have ended up in a place where I am happy with the design and the content, therefore, this sprint was a
        success.

	            Internet privacy is the safekeeping of users’ personal data published on the internet, ensuring that
                there is a high level of privacy and security so that their details are not available for the public or
                malicious parties to	access. This may include things like personal information such as age, email,
                passwords, location etc, or it	could even be photographs of people. When thinking about privacy, an
                administrator needs to think about	two things: firstly, how to reduce the number of personal details
                need to be given, and secondly, that any data 	is kept safe. This looks like If personal information is
                being shared, then users should also have the ability to delete this (e.g. delete their accounts, change
                their password, hide information like age and location). But generally, things like addresses and phone
                numbers which are not relevant do not need to be received when signing up for the site. In the case of
                photographs, permission would need to be obtained from those in the photos. These people should also
                have the right / ability to take these images down at any point should they no longer consent.

                <div class="fw-bold">Functionality</div>
                Functionality involves ensuring that the website works effectively and efficiently to be useful to anyone
                who uses it. In terms of effectiveness, this looks like making sure that all the links are working, and
                are directing users to the correct pages - this applies not only for links to other pages, or websites,
                but also for objects like buttons which need to perform the correct function. Functionality efficiency
                includes making sure that pages do not take a long time to load, and there are no other glitches or
                bugs on the site. For databases, the databases should be functional, work in the correct way to produce
                the right output. Examples include ensuring that the correct member is displayed in correspondence with
                the post they made, or that when accessing the draw, it queries and outputs the correct information (an
                example where this could go wrong would be trying to find the Prem A draw, but the Junior Prem details
                are outputted instead). To maintain good functionality, we use database plans which allow us to view
                entity relationships, and we can also install the sql installer file to make small changes. To improve
                functionality, testing should always be done to ensure that the database is working, but also testing
                the outputted material in all situations (e.g. how does creating multiple news posts affect how it shows
                on the page, does the container need a scroll…).

                <div class="fw-bold">Sustainability and Future Proofing</div>
                The database should be easily maintained by the administrator, and any edits that need to be made are
                central to only one area. This isn't true for database tables such as news where other tables like member
                need to be referenced with a foreign key, or with comments, where two foreign keys - user and news are both
                referred to. Therefore, if any changes are made to the member table, then all tables that reference this
                member table with a foreign key will automatically adjust with the changes instead of needing to manually
                change each member within each table. The key principle with sustainability and future proofing is that
                the website can be kept up to date so that users in one, five, ten years time have the most relevant
                information. To an extent, this is contingent on the administration keeping things up to date, but
                generally, the idea is that the website can be kept up to date easily and quickly. For example, using
                the edit button to change the draw if something changes, or deleting not so recent news.

                <div class="fw-bold">End User Considerations</div>
                End-user considerations is the umbrella term for relevant implications such as functionality, usability,
                aesthetics, accessibility and health & safety because these all relate to the user who will be interacting
                with the website. However, generally, end-user considerations relate most to usability, ensuring that user’s
                needs, expectations and requirements of the website are met. The data in the database, and ability to enter,
                delete and edit data should be queried and displayed in a way that is easy for users to understand and to use.
                Users should also enjoy the design interface, therefore, it should follow the usability heuristics which includes
                having an aesthetic and minimalist design. Therefore, styling and forms that are created should be both appealing,
                but easy to interact with (clear and organised). Additionally, forms on the website should have catches that prevent
                users from submitting forms with incorrect (e.g. not putting in a valid email address in the sign-up form) or
                impartial information (e.g. when submitting a post to the upcoming events section or recent news).

    <h3>Initial Designs</h3>

    <p> For the WSU site, I first started to plan out what database tables I wanted to include. This also helps me to
        keep track of where foreign keys should be used instead of an entirely new identity, and also to examine how
        the tables all interconnect and interact with each other. The first table that I needed to include was the
        member table as this impacts other tables.
        <ul>
        <li>
        On the news page, there are three tables - comments, recent news and upcoming events. Therefore, this
        is the page where most of the database activity is occurring. Since WSU is an organisation that arranges
        debates and public speaking competitions, recent news and upcoming events will be key features of the site
        and therefore, should be prioritised. This allows all four groups of expected users: teachers, students,
        coaches as well as judges to be able to keep up with events that they can attend, and what happened at those
        various competitions. For the administrators, or other authorised users, this will be the hub for keeping
        those users up-to-date, and it should be easy for them to use the forms to post, edit and delete various
        news items.
        </li>
        <li>
        Another useful database that is not set in the "news" page is the draw table. This was a popular demand from
        the interviews conducted in the planning stage. Many students and coaches like to keep up to date with who
        their teams will be debating, and also to look back on what debates have already happened.
        </li>
        </ul>

    <h5>Reflection</h5>
    <p>
        When I first installed the SQL, I didn’t understand what it meant to choose a “dialect”. By using SQLite, this
        means that I can easily add to and reinstall the database if needed. Additionally, I created a test file which will
        be used to test queries before adding them to my server.py file, and before I attach the database to the front-end
        server page. This test file was a really good idea because it meant that I could test out any code in queries before
        actually trying to put it in the server route code which would get outputted.
    <br>
        I needed to create the member table first because a couple of my other tables use member_id as a foreign key.
        This process went smoothly, and I created example members to insert into the table. By doing this, it means that
        I can test out users with different authorisation levels later on.
    <br>
        The last thing I did in this sprint was create the news table. This is one of the key tables within my database,
        and just like with the member table, I loaded in some example news items. Both the member table and the news table
        were successful when I tested the query.

        This was a process that went relatively smoothly. There were some issues with styling when it came to making the
        container remain the same height as the other container on the page. This was especially true when more news items
        were added. To remedy this, I had to put a fixed height on the container, and allow overflow to scroll which overall
        created a clean look. In this sprint, I had to both put a search query on server.py and then link it to the page
        where it outputs. There were a few mishaps with typos which meant that I received errors, however, I managed to solve
        these.

        This form also went well without too many issues. There were some issues with editing as some tests would

        it was my first time using [GET] and [POST] which were slightly confusing to get my head around, however,
        now I know that [GET] retrieves data from some requested source whilst [POST] processes and sends data to a

        This was a relatively easy process because it just uses a simple search query to look for members, and if the
        member doesn’t exist, then an error will come up and it won’t let someone login. I didn't change anything from
        my initial plan. At one point, I couldn't actually log in because the password wasn't working but that was due
        to minute errors which I quickly fixed. I also learnt how to use a dictionary, and to autofill a value so that testing out authorised members' access to various other tables would
        be easier in the future.

        The sign-up page took a while because I first had to build a confirmation page (which I didn't end up using in the final

        the page correctly. However, when I finally got past this hurdle, building the signup page was relatively easy because I
        already had some practice building forms with the log-in page (because I accidentally did these in the
        wrong order), therefore, this was an easy task. It was interesting learning about the python dictionary, and
        something that I could use in other databases as well.

        This was almost identical to the “recent news” database, therefore, a lot of the same processes went into it
        which made it do-able. There were a few hitches because there was a different front-end look (I was using cards)
        for these upcoming events, however, eventually I got it working. The main issue was that the information wasn’t
        displaying into the cards, but after figuring out that there were a few small mistakes with the values tuple,
        I fixed them quickly. The cards wouldn’t stay the same height when new information was added into them, however,
        after adding h-100, the cards worked.

            Originally, I had a single page for each of the different grades (Senior Cert, Junior Prem, Prem A) etc. However,

    <h5>Reflection</h5>
    <p>
        This was a tricky task, and some of my plans changed. Initially, I had individual pages for each of the five
        grades (Premier Advanced, Premier B… etc), however, this took up a lot of space and I found a way to have one
        draw page which would open to the correct draw when the link was requested. With my initial individual pages, the
        search query would have to be duplicated each time with the specific grade referenced. When I changed it, it would
        search the draw for the grade that was requested from the competitions page (when you clicked the link), and that way
        I only needed one draw page instead of five draw pages. For draw pages that currently had no data (because I couldn't
        find all of the information of each debate this year), I programmed an error page to come up. The main difficulty I had
        in this sprint was linking the edit and the delete buttons to the draw_cud, but I managed to fix this. When I finally
        linked it, I ran into the issue of the page not actually updating with the new information, but turns out it was just
        a typo in the code. Additionally, creating the accordion proved to be difficult. I first tried to create a new
        separate accordion each time but the code got really messy, especially with the IDs. In the end, Mr Khouri helped
        me create a loop which would sense when the round name changed and then create a new section with the
        corresponding round’s data.

        This was also quite a difficult task. I initially had a lot of useless code, and although the test_query showed
        that the comments were being received, the actual comments weren’t being loaded onto the page correctly. This
        led me to try and change the code around, which worked! However, there were still some issues with the user
        not being displayed, and not a clear enough separation between who is speaking / other people’s replies. I managed
        to fix this too! After I added the comments, I realised that the code for the news items was wrong because it wouldn’t
        delete. After looking around, I realised it was because the comments existing were preventing the news item from being
        deleted. Therefore, I had to implement new code which would delete the comments at the same time as the news delete
        was being asked for.

                <div class="fw-bold">Privacy</div>
	            Unfortunately, attention has not been focused on the privacy aspect of this site. However, this is not of
                huge concern to us at this moment because the databases are unable to be directly accessed by any users of
                the site. Using the shortcut http:..../data in the search bar will not take users to the data folder.
                In the case where the builder (myself) or any other admins are able to access the data folder, all passwords
                are censored out. Additionally, the site is not built with the intention of collecting much personal or
                valuable data from each of the users as there is no need or use for that. Therefore, any data that is
                collected by the site should not need to be of any concern to the users. The maximum amount of data that
                is collected is a password, and email - both of which are not sources of compromising information such as
                an address, age, school etc would be. We also have not done much about the privacy of persons displayed in
                our photos. The current photos in the site as of this moment were taken and displayed with permission, and
                it will be up to the administrators to take down photos wherein the person photographed no longer consents
                to having their image displayed on the page. Photos that are attached to (eg) an upcoming news item, or past
                event which are connected to databases have the ability to be removed as part of the "edit" function on these
                specific databases.

                <div class="fw-bold">Functionality</div>
                Through the construction of this website, all of the functions have been tested regularly and thoroughly.
                This means that I checked through all of the button functions, made sure that all of the links were taking
                the user to the correct page (this was especially important for the draw page because it was just one page
                and was dependent on the variable it “received”). When I found a glitch or a bug, I would focus on making sure
                that it was fixed before I continued with any other tasks, this meant that nothing was left forgotten, and
                it also meant that I wasn’t accidentally making the problem worse if databases were linked. In the development
                process of my databases, I would perform test queries before moving the code onto my server.py and before
                using it on my front-end page. The ability to look at my tables through the database table viewer was also
                particularly useful in ensuring that the correct information was being stored. Generally, data was only kept
                in one table, and if it was needed somewhere else, then I used foreign keys to reference the correct table.
                For example, in both schedule and news, they used a foreign key to reference the member table. My comments
                were a unique case which used TWO foreign keys (news and member). By using the SQL installer file, I was
                able to make small changes, and feel confident. The db_functions.py also let me reset anything to the base
                level if I had logged in, or created a lot of news posts which I no longer wanted to remain on the page.

                <div class="fw-bold">Sustainability and Future Proofing</div>
                It is really easy to add new features due to the relational database design which connects various entities
                to one another. This means that existing tables don’t need to be adjusted to cater for the addition of a
                new table. Additionally, by using foreign keys, it means that if another table is referenced (as I
                mentioned earlier), then the related table will automatically update without needing to do so manually.
                This means that everything is central to one point, and users don’t need to be making changes in multiple
                areas which improves the efficiency of the site. Additionally, with the incorporation of create, edit and
                delete buttons, it is easy for the website to be kept up to date if one chooses to do so. Users are directed
                to an easy to use form with no hitch. For the creation of the 'draw', I initially planned to have three
                different tables - grade, round, and finally the draw - however, this was excessive and in order to reduce
                resources and to make it easier to maintain everything, I condensed everything into one table. In this
                situation, the grade, round and draw did not have to be separate entities, and could still effectively operate
                in one table. This made it much easier for a user to make edits, or to add a new draw because it was all
                in one table rather than three.

                Although most of the design elements in the site have consideration of viewers who are using different
                devices (e.g. a mobile phone), I have not necessarily considered these varying screen sizes when it comes
                to the design and styling of the forms thus far. Whilst they should still be usable, they may not be to the
                standard that is comfortable for all types of users. However, for laptop users, all of the forms and ability
                to query and post data is easy and displayed well. They are easy to interact with because the forms clearly
                direct what is required in a section, and also have extra catches which will prevent a user from submitting
                too early (not null), or filling in the same information twice (unique). When the user has filled out the
                form and submitted, it should take them directly to the page where the information has been outputted onto
                so that they can confirm that their change has been processed correctly. If not, then an error page with
                an error message will be displayed. I did not initially have this for the draw page, but this is extremely
                important and now is working fine.

                    Through my website, intellectual property was a relevant implication that needed a lot of consideration.
                    This is because I needed a lot of photos on my website to showcase the talented debaters. To address this,
                    I photographed the majority of the images used on the website, ensuring that I obtained permission from
                    the people captured in them. For the photos that were not taken by me, I requested permission of use
                    from the original photographer. Additionally, my website needed a few “symbol” images on my homepage,
                    however, I did not know how to make these myself. Therefore, I found some on the internet, however,
                    I ensured that they had a create commons licence which allowed me to use them freely. The text that
                    is on my website is inspired by the old WSU site, especially surrounding specific facts, however,
                    it is all written in my own words.

                    Unfortunately, I do not think that accessibility is necessarily maximised for all types of users,
                    Firstly, with the resources available, the coding has primarily been written to work on a laptop
                    or computer, however, I did put in significant efforts to adjust most of the design elements and
                    features for mobile users as well. However, this may mean that some features like entering a post
                    may be difficult for users on mobile devices which is a flaw of this site. However, the website is
                    broadly easy to navigate with a sticky nav bar that allows users to immediately navigate to other
                    pages if they cannot find the information that they need, or if they clicked something wrong.
                    However, accessibility could also be improved for those who have impairments that may affect their
                    online experience. Although I took steps to ensure that font sizing was large enough, that all text
                    colours were appropriate, there is still room for improvement when it comes to ensuring that my
                    website is compatible with text to speech services, better alt tags with my images, skip links,
                    or dyslexia friendly fonts.

                    <div class="fw-bold">Aesthetics</div>
                    As my site has a large variety of in the age demographics of potential users, appropriate aesthetic
                    design was an important consideration in my process. Due to the large amounts of information displayed
                    on the site, it was really important the design was kept clean and tidy so as to not overwhelm the
                    users. I used CRAP design principles to help guide my design decisions. For example, each page
                    uses a consistent colour palette of dark grey, light grey, yellow, and white. This colour scheme
                    helped to maintain cohesiveness and clarity, but also gave me opportunities to play with contrasting
                    colours such as yellow text on a dark grey background. Although yellow can sometimes be difficult to
                    read, the difference between the light and dark made the yellow pop out. On the competitions page, I
                    initially had cards which were very close together. This page has quite a lot of information, therefore,
                    I used the principle “proximity” for two purposes: to group relevant information together (e.g. public
                    speaking competitions were kept together with debating competitions separate), and secondly, to space
                    out the cards. The increased space between the cards decreased clutter, ensuring that the information
                    wasn’t clumping together and making it difficult to read.

                    <div class="fw-bold">Future proofing</div>
                    One of the common frustrations for users about the old WSU site was that the information was outdated,
                    therefore, this was a very important consideration for my site. This particularly pertains to news
                    about the draws, recent news, and upcoming events. Therefore, these are all places where future proofing
                    is especially important. Other information such as resources has the potential to go out-of-date as
                    styles of debating and adjudicating changes, however, this is relatively low-risk. To combat this,
                    I ensured that most of the resources were aimed at low-level basic ideas of debating, as opposed to
                    trends that may go out. For the draw, recent news, and upcoming events, these are all part of a
                    large database and the administrator has the ability to delete, update, and add new items to keep
                    everything relevant.
