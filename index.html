    <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p> This year, I was asked to create a website for the Welligton Speaking Union (WSU),
        an organisation that runs public speaking and debating tournaments for students. <br>
        Their old website was outdated, and Brooke, the current President of WSU wanted a redone site
        for their use. <br>
        Before creating the website, Brooke and I needed to collaborate and discuss what this website
        would be used for, and what we wanted to achieve out of its creation. From this point, we created
        a list of our key aims that would allow Brooke to be as involved in the process, and in providing
        feedback throughout this project.<br>
        In any website, it is important that UX studies are conducted so that the website fits the needs of
        not only the owner, but also the consumers who will be using and navigating the website.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> I contacted and interviewed four categories of users who would be accessing and interacting
       with the website. I wanted to find out their frustrations with the old site, and their expectations
        for the design and the active elements of the site.</li>
        <li> I also did competition analysis to start having an understanding of what needed to be included in
        this site and what other similar websites had used in terms of design and the features that they included.
        This also enables me to think about both what their site is lacking, and doing a good job in to help me
        when choosing what would work for this site. </li>
        <li> Finally, completing a project backlog to have a better grasp on the "big picture" idea for this site
        but evidently, this is just a simple plan with none of the specific details of features and designs included
        as these are subject to change.</li>
        </ul>

                Unfortunately, attention has not been focused on the privacy aspect of this site. However, this is not
                of huge concern to us at this moment because the databases are unable to be directly accessed by any
                users of the site. Using the shortcut http:..../data in the search bar will not take users to the
                data folder. In the case where the builder (myself) or any other admins are able to access the data
                folder, all passwords are censored out. Additionally, the site is not built with the intention of
                collecting much personal or valuable data from each of the users as there is no need or use for that.
                Therefore, any data that is collected by the site should not need to be of any concern to the users. The
                maximum amount of data that is collected is password, and email - both of which are not sources of
                compromising information such as an address, age, school etc would be.
                We also have not done much about privacy of persons displayed in our photos. The current photos in the
                site as of this moment were taken and displayed with permission, and it will be up to the administrators
                to take down photos wherein the person photographed no longer consents to having their image displayed
                on the page. Photos that are attached to (eg) an upcoming news item, or past event which are connected
                to databases have the ability to be removed as part of the "edit" function on these specific databases.

    <ul>

        <li><h4>Privacy:</h4> To be honest we have not done much about privacy. But the database should not be directly
        accessible by the user. For example http://127.0.0.1:5000/data should not take us to the data folder.<br>
        You can test and see that it doesn't. Passwords should be hashed, and the minum of personal data should be connected from the user.<br>
        For example, there is no point collecting their address and phone number.</li>

        <li><h4>Functionality:</h4> This means that the database should work properly. It should not have errors and the data
        should be completely consistent between different cells in the same column. For example, using the SQLite data format
        "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:00". Foreign key references need to be correct, so, for example, the correct member is associated
        with the news post that they made. Functionality is addressed by creating precise entity relationship diagrams, creating an
        sql installer fiile so that small changes and corrections are easy to implement and by comprehensive testing of the database output
        on the web pages</li>

        <li><h4>Sustainability and Future Proofing:</h4> This means that the database should be easy to maintain.<br>
        Any corrections to names, titles or dates should only happen in one place in the database. If they need to be used in other tables
        they should be referenced using foreign keys. An example of this could be the members or users stored in the database.
        If their names are to be used in another part of the database, for example associated with posting a news item, there should be
        a foreign key reference in the news table. This means that if a name is updated or other details added, then the new
        name would appear in the news item, without any changes having to be made there.<br>
        Overall the database tables should be for different 'entities', people, dance classes, news items, schedule items etc.
        This also makes it easy to add new tables without altering what is already there.
        </li>

        <li><h4>End user considerations:</h4> The data in the database needs to be queried and presented in a way that caters
        to the users needs.<br>
        It should be presented in a clear organised structure and formatted to meet the expectations that users have for a modern website.<br>
        Forms that allow the user to add, update or delete entries in the database should be simple to use and have validation
        (or 'undos') to help the user avoid entering in incorrect or partial information.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h3> Initial Designs</h3>

    <p> This is my staring design for a database for the pasta site. The news page will be an important way of keep
        people up to date with the latest events. Authorised users should be able to add a news event easily and should
    also be able to update or delete one.<br>
    This is the first priority.<br>
    Other useful features of the database are all the items on the menu, combo deals and also a members table.</p>

    <h3>Sprint (Number)</h3>
    <h4> Aim: </h4>
    <p>To create the first iteration of the database:
        Build only two linked tables: news and member tables.
    <br> Run installation and test</p>
    <p>The data plan for these tables is below</p>

    </div>

    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    <p> It took a few goes to get the sql installer file running but,now it is place,
        I can add to it and reinstall the database whenever I want to.
    This will be very useful.<br>
    After a few false starts I got the query to run and print out, using a testing file.
        This means I can work out and test a query before implementing in the flask server file.</p>
